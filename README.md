# Rubyhacknight meetups

[Rubyhacknight](http://www.meetup.com/ruby-hacknight-london/) is a meetup focused on hacking ruby related apps and libs.

## Format

The meetup is very free-form, but to be able to know what to expect

1. Create an issue in this repo if you have a topic you want to hack on and get some people
2. Create a very short introduction to your topic just so everybody know what it is about
3. Come to the Meetup introduce your topic and hack away!

Any code snippets you create, have or want to share, you can post here or link in the issue. To make sure we don't have to many overlapping topics we will assign the issues to Milestones representing the meetups coming up.
